# di2008
Simple application for reading and printing readings from a DI-2008 data acquisition device in CDC mode.

CDC mode is Communications Device Class which allows the DI-2008 to operate as a conventional RS-232 serial port.

This program is intended as a demo/starter for building a more advanced, application-specific program.
